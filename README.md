🌍 What is indiayz?

indiayz is an official, unified, open-source AI toolkit designed to simplify how developers build and scale AI-powered applications.

Instead of stitching together dozens of unrelated libraries, indiayz provides a single, consistent interface across modern AI domains — from LLMs and image generation to audio, video, agents, and automation.

Philosophy:
Powerful AI systems should be simple to use, transparent, and future-proof.

✨ Why indiayz?

✅ One toolkit, many AI capabilities

✅ Clean abstractions over battle-tested open-source libraries

✅ Offline & local-first friendly (run models on your own machine)

✅ Modular architecture — use only what you need

✅ Production-oriented design

✅ Built with long-term maintainability in mind

This project is not a wrapper dump.
It is a carefully engineered SDK focused on clarity, consistency, and extensibility.
